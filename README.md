# Web-Player

This is just a random quick project I made during vacations because I had no internet for almost a week

The webapp is clearly not optimized, please do not yell at me for declaring 32 states in a row and re-rendering every 2ms ':)

# Starting the app

If you want to run the app locally, execute the following:

```
npm install
npm start
```

# Live Demo

If you are too lazy to run it locally or just want to see how it looks first, there is a demo available at [player.cstef.dev](player.cstef.dev)

# Contributing

Pull requests are welcome, I will review them as quick as possible
